To build from cvs, do the following:

 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure
 make
 make install

You will need recent versions of GNU automake and
autoconf in order to build from the CVS tree.

NOTE:  The README.txt file in the distribution
is auto-generated from perl ".pod" format by
the "pod2text" included in most perl distributions.
