README for externals/moocow/extended/ build hacks.

Last updated Thu, 02 Aug 2007 00:48:50 +0200

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This directory is for pd-extended compatible builds of (some of)
moocow's externals directly from the CVS repository.

=head1 USAGE

Issuing the following commands to the shell:

  cd externals/moocow/extended (or wherever you extracted the distribution)
  make

... should result in all objects being compiled into extended/build/externs.
This is intended to be called from externals/Makefile.

=head1 SUPPORTED EXTERNALS

This makefile currently supports the following of moocow's externals:

 deque
 pdstring    (just the dummy object, not the library!)
 any2string
 string2any
 readdir
 weightmap

The following of moocow's externals are unsupported (for various reasons):

 flite
 gfsm
 ratts
