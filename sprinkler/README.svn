To build from subversion sources, do the following:

 ./svn-prepare.sh
 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure
 make
 make install

You will need recent versions of GNU automake and
autoconf in order to build from the SVN tree.

The './svn-prepare.sh' script requires some shared code
in the directory ../common (relative to the package root
directory).

The README.txt file in the distribution is auto-generated
from perl ".pod" format by the "pod2text" included in most
Perl distributions.
